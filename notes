1. Java static key word:
    Static keyword can be used with class, variable, method and block. Static members belong to the class instead of a specific instance, this means if you make a member static, you can access it without object.

2. Static Class
    A class can be made static only if it is a nested class.
        1) Nested static class doesnâ€™t need reference of Outer class
        2) A static class cannot access non-static members of the Outer class

3. @ means annotation in java

4. Serializable interface

5. Array vs ArrayList
    Array: Simple fixed arrays that we create in Jave, like below
        int arr[] new int[10]
    ArrayList: Dynamic sized arrays in Java that implement List interface
        ArrayList<Type> arrL = new ArrayList<Type>();

   // A Java program to demonstrate differences between array
   // and ArrayList
   import java.util.ArrayList;
   import java.util.Arrays;
   
   class Test
   {
       public static void main(String args[])
       {
           /* ........... Normal Array............. */
           int[] arr = new int[3];
           arr[0] = 1;
           arr[1] = 2;
           System.out.println(arr[0]);
   
           /*............ArrayList..............*/
           // Create an arrayList with initial capacity 2
           ArrayList<Integer> arrL = new ArrayList<Integer>(2);
   
           // Add elements to ArrayList
           arrL.add(1);
           arrL.add(2);
   
           // Access elements of ArrayList
           System.out.println(arrL.get(0));
       }
   }

6. Throws vs Throw 
    1. throws clause is used to declare an exception and throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.
    2. If we see syntax wise then throw is followed by an instance variable and throws is followed by exception class names.
    3. The keyword throw is used inside method body to invoke an exception and throws clause is used in method declaration (signature).
    For example

    throw
        throw new Exception("You have some exception")
        throw new IOException("Connection failed!!")

    throws
        public int myMethod() throws IOException, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException {}

    4. You cannot declare multiple exceptions with throw. You can declare multiple exception e.g. public void method()throws IOException,SQLException.
    5. checked exceptions can not be propagated with throw only because it is explicitly used to throw an particular exception. checked exception can be propagated with throws.

7. Use the string.equals(Object other) function to compare strings, not the == operator.
    The function checks the actual contents of the string, the == operator checks whether the references to the objects are equal.

8. UUID: Universally Unique Identifier, represents a 128-bit long value which guarantees uniquencess across time and space

9. ConcurrentHashMap
