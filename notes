1. Java static key word:
    Static keyword can be used with class, variable, method and block. Static members belong to the class instead of a specific instance, this means if you make a member static, you can access it without object.

2. Static Class
    A class can be made static only if it is a nested class.
        1) Nested static class doesnâ€™t need reference of Outer class
        2) A static class cannot access non-static members of the Outer class
